This tool will allow you to keep track of your progress through the various pantheons in Hollow Knight's  
Godmaster DLC. For pantheons, first select the pantheon that you are attempting. Each time you die, select  
the god who ended your run, or press the + button if they are already selected. The Stats button will  
show your number of attempts, successes, and success rate for each boss in the pantheon. 

I hope you have fun with Hollow Knight.
